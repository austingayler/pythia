A web interface for everything that I want to do with my Raspberry Pi.  
Uses Bootstrap, Flot, SciPy, smtp  
  
Current features:  
-Hosts a database for favorite quotes (also can be vocab words or anything else you want to memorize), and texts them to me at certain intervals (set up a cron job to run text.py)  
-Monitors audio levels in the living room it's placed it and plots that data
